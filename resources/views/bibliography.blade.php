            <h1>Michael Howland <br> Web Development Artisan</h1>
            <p>
                I have been developing websites using the Yii framework for several years and have projects that are functional and in use.
                One of the projects I have developed is a product production system for the company I currently work for. My company is an online retail business that sells specialised glass for decorative fusing. This involves the processing of glass sheets into various products. The website I designed databases the production of the products, storing the quantity made and when. I felt that this system was needed as the old way of handling this was through time consuming paper work and email, which led to stock discrepancies due to poor records. This led to time wastage when these inconsistencies needed to be investigated. Now everything is stored online and can be searched by date and product itâ€™s now a lot easier to find where things went wrong.
                I have also developed a functioning ecommerce website. 
                <br><br>
                I have written all the code for the database and common functionality you would find on an ecommerce website. I understand that this can be done much more easily using websites like Big commerce and pre-existing ecommerce framework, however, the point of doing this was a learning exercise to take me to the next level of my understanding of PHP, MSQL and ecommerce functionality.
                I have also developed a website for a fictional company as part of my college course, this focuses more on the web design aspect of web development.
